issues:

model.py and seed.py
1.
-in the table "language_desired", my foreignkey/primary key pair for language is the id. BUT< I want this to the language code. Same goes for country code. So, take a look at the languages_desired table and it's just a bunch of incoherent numbers. Do I want to keep it like this? 

!!!  - this may be because the code (language code = 'es_ES') that's given the foreign key is linked with a primary key (number), so they aren't actually the same value. THat's why it can't connect on it. So should I have the numeric id input at the time of population and user input?


2.
 -how can I access the country_name from a user instance:
This should work in 'python -i model.py'

andrea = session.query(User)filter_by(name="Andrea Mitchell").first()

andrea.country
--> <object USA>

andrea.country.country_name
--> u"USA"

   I need this for my profile page to display the name and not the code

index bugs to fix:

1. if user enters random stuff, it refreshes but doesn't flash any message. It should flash some sort of instruction/reason.

2. when I'm logged in, I can just hit back and it goes back to login state


3. convo q's: Because they need to be ordered, should I have all the questions by category, extract them all as a list, then loop through them to pass each question to both browsers?


login manager - flask plugin

function is logged in to check if user's in session
