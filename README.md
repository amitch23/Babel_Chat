Babel Chat
========
Babel Chat is a video chat web app that allows language learners to connect with native speakers of their target language and engage in guided, interactive chat sessions.

Providing an internationally convenient, entirely browser-hosted video language exchange, Babel Chat users can play games that cater to various learning styles while strengthening vocabulary, grammar, and communication skills. Users may also choose to discuss common themes by responding to questions in the chatbox, all in real time.
